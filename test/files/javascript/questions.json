        "title": "react-apollo: Firing query in response to user input (e.g. onClick)",
        "body": "\r\n\r\n(cross-posted from https://spectrum.chat/apollo/react-apollo/firing-query-in-response-to-user-input-e-g-onclick~13ae09a8-6028-48cf-ac3f-3fbba2307ccc)\n\nI've spent the afternoon beating my head against what I think should be a fairly straightforward task: firing a query in response to user input; for example, a search field.\n\nI have an app that accepts user input in a search field. I need to make a query, setting a variable to the value of that field, when the user clicks the \"search\" button. The query needs to be set to network-only so that it fetches fresh data each time. When the query completes, I need to display a detail component that displays the data fetched from the server. That detail view contains a couple of <Mutation /> components that make updates to the user's data. The detail view needs to stay in sync so that it reflects the current state.\n\nI've tried a couple of approaches to this, and each one gets me part way there, but not all the way. I'm sure I'm missing something simple.\n\nApproach 1: <Query /> Component\n\nThe top-level app component looks something like this (simplified from the actual):\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [searchFieldValue, setSearchFieldValue] = useState('');\n  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <Container>\n      <Input\n        placeholder=\"Username\"\n        name=\"username\"\n        id=\"username\"\n        value={searchFieldValue}\n        width={6}\n        onChange={(e, { value }) => {\n          setSearchFieldValue(value);\n        }}\n        />\n        <Button onClick={ () => { \n          setUsername(searchFieldInput)\n        }>Search</Button>\n\n        {username && <DetailView username={username} />\n    </Container>\n}\n\nconst DetailView = ({username}) => (\n  <Query query={GET_USER} variables={{username}} fetchPolicy=\"network-only\">\n    {({data, loading, error}) => {\n      if (loading) return <Loading />\n      if (error) return <Error />\n      const { user } = data;\n      return (\n      // display user data\n      // includes a couple of buttons that trigger mutations on the user\n      )\n    }}\n  </Query>\n)\n\n\nIn essence, when the \"search\" button is clicked, I set the username state variable to the content of the search field. This causes username to no longer be falsey, and the DetailView component is mounted.\n\nWhat works:\n\nThe query is sent to the server the, data is received and stored in the cache, and the view is rendered. The mutations all work properly, and the cache is updated with their outcome. If I enter a different value in the search input, this causes <App />'s state to change and re-render; the child Query is re-rendered, and a new query is sent, etc.\n\nWhat doesn't work:\n\nI can't search for the same user twice. For example, let's say I enter \"janesmith\" in the search field. I get Jane's information and the <DetailView /> is rendered. If I want to re-fetch Jane's details by clicking the search button again, nothing happens, because <App />'s state hasn't actually changed.\n\nI know that I can render a control as a child of the Query inside DetailView and have it trigger the refetch function, but that's not what I want - I want the search button to fire the query every time.\n\nOne possible workaround I've considered is converting App to a Class component, and having the search button's click handler do something like `this.setState({username: null}, () => { this.setState({ username: searchFieldInput} )}), which should trigger a re-render, but this seems incredibly hacky.\n\nApproach 2: <ApolloConsumer /> and firing query() manually\n\nThe react-apollo docs on queries suggest that for manually firing a query in response to user input, one should use ApolloConsumer and call client.query() manually in the click handler:\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [searchFieldValue, setSearchFieldValue] = useState('');\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  return (\n    <ApolloConsumer>\n      {client => (\n        <Container>\n        <Input\n          placeholder=\"Username\"\n          name=\"username\"\n          id=\"username\"\n          value={searchFieldValue}\n          width={6}\n          onChange={(e, { value }) => {\n            setSearchFieldValue(value);\n          }}\n          />\n        <Button onClick={async () => { \n          const data = await client.query({\n            query: GET_USER,\n            variables: {\n              username: searchFieldValue\n            },\n            fetchPolicy='network-only'\n          })\n          setUser(data.user);\n        }>Search</Button>\n\n        {user && <DetailView user={user} setUser={setUser} />\n        </Container>\n      )}\n    </ApolloConsumer>\n  )\n}\n\nconst DetailView = ({user, setUser}) => (\n  // .... render the user detail\n  // includes a couple of <Mutation /> components that modify the user\n  // These need to have the setUser function passed down to them so that they can update the state in <App />\n)\n\n\nWhat works:\n\nWhen the search button is clicked, the query is sent to the server. The result is returned, and is stored in the cache. However there is no way to use the cache value in <DetailView /> in this case; the result has to be stored in state and passed down.\n\nBecause the query is being fired imperatively in the onClick handler, I can search for the same value over and over and it will send the queries to the server (due to the network-only fetch policy).\n\nWhat doesn't work:\n\nAlthough the mutations in DetailView work, and the cache is updated when they return, the UI does not update because it is the result of <App />'s state object. This means that in order to have the UI react to the result of the mutations, I need to pass my setUser function down through the props of all the children of DetailView (where the mutations live), and call setUser in the onCompleted handler of the mutations. This should work, but seems like a lot of unnecessary work. Also, I can't easily react to the loading and error states when calling client.query() imperatively.\n\nOne thing I've considered, but haven't tried, is a combination of both imperative and declarative: wrap <App /> in <ApolloConsumer> and fire the query manually in the button's onClick handler with a network-only fetch policy, and have the DetailView component render a <Query/> component for the same query, but with a cache-only fetch policy. Again, this seems overly cumbersome.\n\nLike I said, I'm sure I'm missing something extremely simple, but I can't see what it is. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n    ",

Which kind of makes senses when following along with the code. Problem is; I have no idea how to solve that. \n\nThe hardest thing for me to wrap my head around is being able to render a parent component which has onEditable set to hide when one of it's children has it set to show. \n\nThat might sound confusing, so I'll explain some more. A parent component with onEditable set to hide cascades this property to it's children (in the way I want my HOC), but if down the line a child or grandchild has this prop set to show, all his parents need to render as well, but not his siblings (because they still have the hide property from their parents, unless specified otherwise)\n\nSo I expect the following DOM structure in my example:\n\n<p onEditable=\"show\">show</p>\nUnspecified\n<div onEditable=\"hide\">\n  <span onEditable=\"show\">show inside hide</span>\n</div>\n<div onEditable=\"show\">\n  <p>Unspecified in show</p>\n</div>\n\n    ",

        "body": "\r\n\r\nIn trying to convert a set of individual event listeners into one listener on the parent container conditioned using the matches method on the evt.target, I've run into a bit of difficulty.\n\nOne of the elements in the parent can have an unknown number of user added elements that may also have children, grand children, etcetera. Using evt.target returns the child element.  Is there a selector string using matches or another method than can have the same effect as placing the event on the element and using evt.currentTarget?\n\nFor example, this is similar to the HTML I'm dealing with and I want to place the event listener on div of id=\"parent\". \n\n<div id=\"parent\">\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td></td>\n        <td>\n          <div class=\"text\">   \n            <textarea></textarea>\n            <div></div>\n           </div>\n         </td>\n       </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n\nMost of it works fine, but the div under the textarea inside div.text is the problem.  A mouse event on div.text is all that is needed but the event is on the parent.  Many tr elements and many divisions of class=\"text\" may be added by the user and the inner div can be filled with user-selected tags within tags.\n\nMy question is how can I capture a mouse event on any tag within div.text > div or the div.text, apart from having to give each tag an additional class?\n\nUsing matches( '.text *' ), as I read in one of the questions here, works if click on the textarea or an empty area of the inner div, but if click on one of its children then it doesn't match.\n\nI don't think this the same as desiring a parent selector in CSS, because I want any child of the parent regardless of tag type.\n\nI appreciate any guidance you may be able to provide.\n\nThank you.\n    ",

        "body": "\r\n\r\nI'm having this problem where my app updates too much. In my reducer I have an action of interest checkTasks. It doesn't do much, checkTasks goes through my list of current tasks, if any of them is expired, it removes them from the tasks array to place them into the expiredTasks array. My problem is that most of the time, checkTasks doesn't do anything, only sometimes. But every time checkTasks gets called my component gets rendered.\n\nThe mapStateToProps of my component looks like this:\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (_state) => {\n    return {\n        tasks: _state.tasksState\n    }\n}\n\n\nand my component cares about 2 attributes from the state:\n\nfunction Tasts({ tasksState: _tasksState}){\n    ...\n    return <>\n        {renderExpired(_tasksState.expiredTasks)}\n        {renderTasks(_tasksState.tasks)}\n    </>\n}\n\n\nreducer\n\nconst reducer(_state = { tasks: [], expiredTasks: [] }, _action){\n    const newState = { ..._state };\n    ...\n    case 'checkTasks':\n            for (let i = newState.tasks.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                if (isExpired(newState.tasks[i])) {\n                    newState.expiredTasks.push(newState.tasks.splice(i, 1)[0]);\n                }\n            }\n        break;\n\n    ...\n\n    return newState;\n}\n\n\nWhat I'm noticing is that every time (once per second) the checkTasks action gets called, my component rerenders, even if practically the information in expiredTasks and tasks hasn't changed.\n\nIf I could change my mapStateToProps to something like \n\nconst mapStateToProps = (_state) => {\n    return {\n        tasks: _state.tasksState.tasks,\n        expiredTasks: _state.tasksState.expiredTasks\n    }\n}\n\n\nThat would probably stop the constant refreshes, however, that seems to break all refreshes. Including tasks moving from one array to the other. I don't know if there's a way to tell redux NOT to trigger an update from the reducer, although that's probably an anti-pattern.\nI'm also trying not to go trough shouldComponentUpdate given that evaluating whether I should update may require to check 2 object arrays against each other. Not triggering an update in the first place is much easier to handle than having to compare multiple arrays.\n    ",

If the boolean is false, then I want the system to direct user to a specific page.\n\n\nAt first, I am thinking to use the $(window).unload() and then do a ajax to my java code to do this logic, however, I found that the unload method is already remove from latest jQuery.\n\n** My jQquery version is jQuery v1.12.4**\n\nAny suggestion or better solution to do this approach?\n\nKindly advise. \n    ",
