Note that these are all <em>incidental</em> outputs, not the primary purpose of the application which would be displayed or saved elsewhere and using different methods.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some of these (probably only the very severe ones) might require a dialog box if run interactively; but it needs to log without stalling for user input if run in batch mode; and if run as a library the client program obviously wants to intercept and/or examine the errors as they occur.</p></li>\n<li><p>It all needs to be cross-platform: Linux, Windows, OSX.  And we want the solution to not be weird on any platform.  For example, output to stderr is fine for Linux, but won't work on Windows when linked to a GUI app.</p></li>\n<li><p>Client programs of the library may create multiple instances of the main class, and it would be nice if the client app could distinguish a separate error stream with each instance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's assume everybody agrees it's good enough for the library methods to log errors via a simple call (error code and/or severity, then printf-like arguments giving an error message).  The contentious part is how this is recorded or retrieved by the client app.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've done this many times over the years, and am never fully satisfied with the solution.  Furthermore, it's the kind of subproblem that's actually not very important to users (they want to see the error log if something goes wrong, but they don't really care about our technique for implementing it), but the topic gets the programmers fired up and they invariably waste inordinate time on this detail and are never quite happy.</p>\n\n<p>Anybody have any wisdom for how to integrate this functionality into a C++ API, or is there an accepted paradigm or a good open source solution (not GPL, please, I'd like a solution I can use in commercial closed apps as well as OSS projects)?</p>\n",

Why not try setting a breakpoint just after getting a successful return-code from OpenClipboard() and step through your code.  According to the Internet it may work on your system, but of course, not on mine, thanks for trying.  </p>\n\n<p>Googling on e.g. (( OpenClipboard 1418 vc6 )) finds articles like \"GetClipboardData fails in debugger\" and \"No Error in VC++6 but Error in VC++ 2005\".  Pragmatically for-the-moment, problem solved - I simply cannot set breakpoints within such code, I need to squirrel information and set the breakpoint after the clipboard operations are done.  Error 1418 is \"Thread does not have a clipboard open\" but it works fine as long as you don't step with VS.NET, or like I say if you keep breakpoints outside of the clipboard-open-close-block.<p>\nI would feel better knowing what the exact issue is with the VS.NET debugger.<p>\nBeing a C++ person I am only dimly aware that you are not supposed to think in terms of threads when doing dot-Net.  Anyway I did not find a guru-quality explanation of what's really going on, whether in-fact the problem is that the dot-Net debugger is subtly interfering with the thread-information somehow, when you single-step thru native C++ code.  <P></p>\n\n<p>System-wise:  about a year old, two dual-core Xeon's, 4 CPU's according to XP-pro.\n  I had just finished debugging the code by single-stepping thru it in vc6 under XP-SP2-32-bit.  So I know the code was pretty-much-fine under vc6.  However when I tested with a 10-megabyte CF_TEXT I got exceptions.  I thought to try debugging under the nicer exception model of XP-x64.<p>\nRecompiled with visual-studio-2008, I could not get the code to single-step at all.  OpenClipboard worked, but EnumClipboardFormats() did not work, nothing worked when single-stepped.  However, when I set the breakpoint below the complete block of code, everything worked fine.  And <em>YES</em> vc2008 made a pinpoint diagnostic 'stack frame corruption around szBuf.  There is a lot to like about vc2008.  It would be nice if this were somehow merely a clipboard problem - without knowing that I would feel compelled to worry about stepping thru ANYTHING, whether thread-context-issues might be due to the dot-Net-debugger.</p>\n",

It should be fast enough that the algorithm can be run at least 100,000 times a second on a modern CPU. It will be implemented in C++.</p>\n\n<p>I am working with spans/ranges, a structure that has a start and an end coordinate on a line.</p>\n\n<p>I have two vectors (dynamic arrays) of spans and I need to merge them. One vector is src and the other dst. The vectors are sorted by span start coordinates, and the spans do not overlap within one vector.</p>\n\n<p>The spans in the src vector must be merged with the spans in the dst vector, such that the resulting vector is still sorted and has no overlaps. Ie. if overlaps are detected during the merging, the two spans are merged into one. (Merging two spans is just a matter of changing the coordinates in the structure.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, there is one more catch, the spans in the src vector must be \"widened\" during the merge. This means that a constant will be added to the start and another (larger) constant to the end coordinate of every span in src. This means that after the src spans are widened they might overlap.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What I have arrived at so far is that it cannot be done fully in-place, some kind of temporary storage is needed. I think it should be doable in linear time over the number of elements of src and dst summed.</p>\n\n<p>Any temporary storage can probably be shared between multiple runs of the algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>The two primary approaches I have tried, which are too slow, are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Append all elements of src to dst, widening each element before appending it. Then run an in-place sort. Finally iterate over the resulting vector using a \"read\" and \"write\" pointer, with the read pointer running ahead of the write pointer, merging spans as they go. When all elements have been merged (the read pointer reaches end) dst is truncated.</p></li>\n<li><p>Create a temporary work-vector. Do a naive merge as described above by repeatedly picking the next element from either src or dst and merging into the work-vector. When done, copy the work-vector to dst, replacing it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first method has the problem that sorting is O((m+n)*log(m+n)) instead of O(m+n) and has somewhat overhead. It also means the dst vector has to grow much larger than it really needs.</p>\n\n<p>The second has the primary problem of a lot of copying around and again allocation/deallocation of memory.</p>\n\n<p>The data structures used for storing/managing the spans/vectors can be altered if you think that's needed.</p>\n\n<p>Update: Forgot to say how large the datasets are. The most common cases are between 4 and 30 elements in either vector, and either dst is empty or there is a large amount of overlap between the spans in src and dst.</p>\n",

It won't actually be deleted when thread1 completes? <strong>Note that access to the global vector will be via a critical section.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think this is how shared_ptrs work but I need to be sure.</p>\n",

I am currently a student at NIU for Computer Science and this does relate to one of my assignments for a class there. So if anyone has a problem read no further and just go on about your business. </p>\n\n<p>Now for anyone who is willing to help heres the situation. For my current assignment we have to read a file that is just a block of text. For each word in the file we are to clear any punctuation in the word (ex : \"can't\" would end up as \"can\" and \"that--to\" would end up as \"that\" obviously with out the quotes, quotes were used just to specify what the example was).</p>\n\n<p>The problem I've run into is that I  can clean the string fine and then insert it into the map that we are using but for some reason with the code I have written it is allowing an empty string to be inserted into the map.

Deliberate compile-time interleaving of floating and integer instructions is another example of this.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have highly-parallel task.  And I typically have an ageing single-core x86 processor without hyper-threading.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a straight-forward way to get my the body of my 'for' loop for this highly-parallel task to be interleaved so that two (or more) iterations are being done together?  (This is slightly different from 'loop unwinding' as I understand it.)</p>\n\n<p>My task is a 'virtual machine' running through a set of instructions, which I'll really simplify for illustration as:</p>\n\n<pre>void run(int num) {\n  for(int n=0; n&lt;num; n++) {\n     vm_t data(n);\n     for(int i=0; i&lt;data.len(); i++) {\n        data.insn(i).parse();\n        data.insn(i).eval();\n     }\n  }  \n}</pre>\n\n<p>So the execution trail might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre>data(1) insn(0) parse\ndata(1) insn(0) eval\ndata(1) insn(1) parse\n...\ndata(2) insn(1) eval\ndata(2) insn(2) parse\ndata(2) insn(2) eval</pre>\n\n<p>Now, what I'd like is to be able to do two (or more) iterations explicitly in parallel:</p>\n\n<pre>data(1) insn(0) parse\ndata(2) insn(0) parse  \\ processor can do OOO as these two flow in\ndata(1) insn(0) eval   /\ndata(2) insn(0) eval   \\ OOO opportunity here too\ndata(1) insn(1) parse  /\ndata(2) insn(1) parse</pre>\n\n<p>I know, from profiling, (e.g. using Callgrind with --simulate-cache=yes), that parsing is about random memory accesses (cache missing) and eval is about doing ops in registers and then writing results back.  Each step is several thousand instructions long.  So if I can intermingle the two steps for two iterations at once, the processor will hopefully have something to do whilst the cache misses of the parse step are occurring...</p>\n\n<p>Is there some c++ template madness to get this kind of explicit parallelism generated?</p>\n\n<p>Of course I can do the interleaving - and even staggering - myself in code, but it makes for much less readable code.  And if I really want unreadable, I can go so far as assembler!  But surely there is some pattern for this kind of thing?</p>\n",

I obviously want to use a framelimiter and have 3D going and all of that at some point, and my main issue is that when I do a send() or receive(), the program kindly idles there and waits for a response. That would lead to maybe 8 fps on even the best internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>So the obvious solution to me is to take the networking code out of the main process and start it up in its own thread. Ideally, I would call a \"send\" in my main process which would pass the networking thread a pointer to the message, and then periodically (every frame) check to see if the networking thread had received the reply, or timed out, or what have you. In a perfect world, I would actually have 2 or more networking threads running simultaneously, so that I could say run a chat window and do a background download of a piece of armor and still allow the player to run around all at once.</p>\n\n<p>The bulk of my problem is that this is a new thing to me. I understand the <em>concept</em> of threading, but I can see some serious issues, like what happens if two threads try to read/write the same memory address at the same time, etc. I know that there are already methods in place to handle this sort of thing, so I'm looking for suggestions on the best way to implement something like this. Basically, I need thread A to be able to start a process in thread B by sending a chunk of data, poll thread B's status, and then receive the reply, also as a chunk of data., ideally without any major crashing going on. ^_^ I'll worry about what that data actually contains and how to handle dropped packets, etc later, I just need to get that happening first.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help/advice.</p>\n\n<p>PS: Just thought about this, may make the question simpler. Is there a way to use the windows event handling system to my advantage? Like, would it be possible to have thread A initialize data somewhere, then trigger an event in thread B to have it pick up the data, and vice versa for thread B to tell thread A it was done? That would probably solve a lot of my problems, since I don't really need both threads to be able to work on the data at the same time, more of a baton pass really. I just don't know if this is possible between two different threads. (I know one thread can create its own messages for the event handler.)</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>C++ was the first programming language I really got into, but the majority of my work on it was academic or for game programming. Most of the programming jobs where I live require Java or .NET programmers and I have a fairly good idea of what technologies they require aside from the basic language. For example, a Java programmer might be required to know EJB, Servlets, Hibernate, Spring, and other technologies, libraries, and frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure about C++, however. In real life situations, for general business programming, what are C++ programmers required to know beyond the language features? Stuff like Win32 API, certain libraries, frameworks, technologies, tools, etc.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: I was thinking of the standard library as well when I said basic language, sorry if it was wrong or not clear. I was wondering if there are any more specific domain requirements similar to all the technologies Java or .NET programmers might be required to learn as apposed to what C++ programmers need to know in general. I do agree that the standard library and Boost are essential, but is there anything beyond that or is it different for every company/project/domain?</p>\n",

Thank you SO, for bringing that to my attention :)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, we have a need to create a relatively generic container type object. It also happens to encapsulate some business related logic. However, we need to store essentially arbitrary data in this container - everything from primitive data types to complex classes.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, one would immediately jump to the idea of a template class and be done with it. However, I have noticed C++ polymorphism and templates do not play well together. Being that there is some complex logic that we are going to have to work, I would rather just stick with either templates OR polymorphism, and not try to fight C++ by making it do both.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, given that I want to do one or the other, I would prefer polymorphism. I find it much easier to represent constraints like \"this container contains Comparable types\" - a la java.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing me to the topic of question: At the most abstract, I imagine that I could have a \"Container\" pure virtual interface that has something akin to \"push(void* data) and pop(void* data)\" (for the record, I am not actually trying to implement a stack).</p>\n\n<p>However, I don't really like void* at the top level, not to mention the signature is going to change every time I want to add a constraint to the type of data a concrete container can work with.</p>\n\n<p>Summarizing: We have relatively complex containers that have various ways to retrieve elements. We want to be able to vary the constraints on the elements that can go into the containers. Elements should work with multiple kinds of containers (so long as they meet the constraints of that particular container).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I should also mention that the containers themselves need to be polymorphic. That is my primary reason for not wanting to use templated C++.</p>\n\n<p>So - should I drop my love for Java type interfaces and go with templates? Should I use void* and statically cast everything? Or should I go with an empty class definition \"Element\" that declares nothing and use that as my top level class in the \"Element\" hierarchy?</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons why I love stack overflow is that many of the responses provide some interesting insight on other approaches that I hadn't not have even considered. So thank you in advance for your insights and comments.</p>\n",

I've been trying to come up with a good way to design for localization of string resources for a Windows MFC application and related utilities. My wishlist is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Must preserve string literals in code (as opposed to replacing with macro #define resource ID's), so that the messages are still readable inline</li>\n<li>Must allow localized string resources (duh)</li>\n<li>Must not impose additional run-time environment restrictions (eg: dependency on .NET, etc.)</li>\n<li>Should have minimal obtrusion into existing code (the less modification the better)</li>\n<li>Should be debuggable</li>\n<li>Should generate resource files which are editable by common tools (ie: common format)</li>\n<li>Should not use copy/paste comment blocks to preserve literal strings in code, or anything else which creates the potential for de-synchronization</li>\n<li>Would be nice to allow static (compile-time) checking that every \"notated\" string is in the resource file(s)</li>\n<li>Would be nice to allow cross-language resource string pooling (for components in various languages, eg: native C++ and .NET)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have a way which fulfills all my wishlist to some extent except for static checking, but I have had to develop a bit of custom code to achieve it (and it has limitations). I'm wondering if anyone has solved this problem in a particularly good way.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nThe solution I currently have looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ShowMessage( RESTRING( _T(\"Some string\") ) );\nShowMessage( RESTRING( _T(\"Some string with variable %1\"), sNonTranslatedStringVariable ) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then have a custom utility to parse out the strings from within the 'RESTRING' blocks and put them into a .resx file for localization, and a separate C# COM object to load them from localized resource files with fallback. If the C# object is not available (or cannot load), I fallback to the string in the code. The macro expands to a template class which calls the COM object and does the formatting, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I thought it would be useful to add what I have now for reference.</p>\n",

I just take the performance improvement for granted, it sounds reasonable but i don't know how much and it certainly depends on the type of container and actual STL implementation in use. But having used this style for a couple months now i actually prefer it over the first anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The reason being readability: the for line is neat and tidy. With qualifiers and member variables in real production code it is quite easy to have <strong>really</strong> long for lines if you use the style in the first example. That's why i intentionally made it to have a horizontal scrollbar in this example, just so you see what i'm talking about. ;)</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, you suddenly introduce the Iter variables to the outer scope of the for loop. But then, at least in the environment i work in, the Iter would have been accessible in the outer scope even in the first example.</p>\n\n<p>What is your take on this? Are there any pro's to the first style other than possibly limiting the scope of Iter?</p>\n",

It is declared like this in Win32 API:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INT WINAPI DrawTextW(HDC hdc, LPCWSTR str, INT count, LPRECT rect, UINT flags)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The LPRECT struct has the following signature (also in Win32 API):</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef struct tagRECT { \n    LONG left;\n    LONG top;\n    LONG right;\n    LONG bottom;\n} RECT LPRECT;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>LONG is a typedef for 32bit integers on 32bit systems (don't know about 64bit systems, it is irrelevant at this point because I am on 32bit Windows). To be able to access the members of this struct I declared it in my C# code...</p>\n\n<pre><code>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Pack = 1)]\n    public struct RECT\n    {\n        public Int32 left;\n        public Int32 top;\n        public Int32 right;\n        public Int32 bottom;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and wrote the signature of P/Invoke using this RECT struct:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[DllImport(\"user32.dll\", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, SetLastError = true, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.StdCall)]\nstatic extern IntPtr DrawText(IntPtr HDC, String str, Int32 count, ref RECT rect, UInt32 flags, IntPtr dtp);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since structs are value types in C# as opposed to being reference types like in C/C++, the ref modifier is necessary here.</p>\n\n<p>However when I use <code>rect.top rect.left</code> etc, they almost always return 0. I know for a fact that this is incorrect. But after googling countless hours and trying a lot of different things, I couldn't make this simple stuff work.</p>\n\n<p>Things I've tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using different primitives for RECT members (int, long, short, UInt32...). Actually it is kinda obvious that this is not a type problem because in any case I should see some garbled numbers, not 0.</li>\n<li>Removing ref modifier. This is also stupid (desperate times, desperate measures) because rect.left correctly returns the pointer to rect instead of its value.</li>\n<li>Tried <code>unsafe</code> code blocks. Didn't work but I may have made a mistake in the implementation (I don't remember what I've done). Besides this approach is generally reserved for tricky pointer situations in COM and Win32, it is overkill for my case anyway.</li>\n<li>Tried adding <code>[MarshallAs]</code> before the members of RECT. Made no difference.</li>\n<li>Played around with <code>Pack</code> values. No difference.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am fairly sure that I'm missing something very easy and straightforward but I have no idea what it is...</p>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>\n",

I suspected I was causing a conflict so moved my equality operators into the class I added, and the compile succeeded.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// engine.h\nnamespace Engine\n{\n    class Vector3Impl { ... };\n    typedef Vector3Impl Vector3;\n    bool operator==(Vector3 const &amp;lhs, Vector3 const &amp;rhs) { ... }\n}\n\n\n// myfile.cpp\n#include \"engine.h\"\n\nnamespace application\n{\n    class MyClass { ... };\n    bool operator==(MyClass const &amp;lhs, MyClass const &amp;rhs) { ... }\n\n    void myFunc(...)\n    {\n        if ( myClassA == myClassB ) { ... } // builds\n    }\n\n    void anotherFunc(...)\n    {\n        Engine::Vector3 a, b;\n        ...\n        if ( a == b ) { ... } // fails\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However after thinking about it I can't see why the compile failed.  There are no implicit conversions from vector3s to my class or vice-versa, and argument-dependent look-up should be pulling in the equality operator from the engine namespace and matching it.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried reproducing this bug in a sample C++ project but that refuses to break.  There must be something in the big big code base that is causing this problem, but I'm not sure where to start looking.  Something like the opposite of a rogue \"using Engine\"?

        "body": "<p>I'm encountering a strange memory read/write error while calling a compiled DLL from C#. I use DllImport to get a handle to the function we need, which writes a return value to a parametric pointer to an int (i.e., int* out). This function is called multiple times within a thread, and runs successfully over the execution life of the first thread. However, if one launches another thread after the first has completed, the call to the external dll throws an AccessViolationException. Since the multiple calls from the first thread execute successfully, I'm thinking this is somehow related to the first thread not releasing the pointers to the relevant integer parameters(?). If so, how can I explicitly release that memory? Or, perhaps someone has a different insight into what might be going on here? Thank you very much.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Danny has requested more specifics, and I'm happy to oblige. Here is where the external routine is invoked:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int success = -1;\n    unsafe\n    {\n        int res = 0;\n        int* res_ptr = &amp;res;\n        int len = cmd.ToCharArray().Length;\n        int* len_ptr = &amp;len;\n        CmdInterpreter(ref cmd, len_ptr, res_ptr);\n        success = *res_ptr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where CmdInterpreter is defined as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [DllImport(\"brugs.dll\", EntryPoint=\"CmdInterpreter\", \n        ExactSpelling=false, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.StdCall)]\n    public static unsafe extern void CmdInterpreter(ref string cmd, int *len, int *res);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please let me know if there is any additional info that would be helpful.

        "body": "<p>So, simple procedure, calculate a factorial number. Code is as follows.</p>\n\n<pre><code>int calcFactorial(int num)\n{\n    int total = 1;\n\n    if (num == 0)\n    {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    for (num; num &gt; 0; num--)\n    {\n        total *= num;\n    }\n\n    return total;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, this works fine and dandy (There are certainly quicker and more elegant solutions, but this works for me) for most numbers. However when inputting larger numbers such as 250 it, to put it bluntly, craps out. Now, the first couple factorial \"bits\" for 250 are { 250, 62250, 15126750, 15438000, 3813186000 } for reference.</p>\n\n<p>My code spits out { 250, 62250, 15126750, 15438000, <strong>-481781296</strong> } which is obviously off. My first suspicion was perhaps that I had breached the limit of a 32 bit integer, but given that 2^32 is 4294967296 I don't think so. The only thing I can think of is perhaps that it breaches a <strong>signed</strong> 32-bit limit, but shouldn't it be able to think about this sort of thing? If being signed is the problem I can solve this by making the integer unsigned but this would only be a temporary solution, as the next iteration yields 938043756000 which is far above the 4294967296 limit.</p>\n\n<p>So, is my problem the signed limit? If so, what can I do to calculate large numbers (Though I've a \"LargeInteger\" class I made a while ago that may be suited!) without coming across this problem again?</p>\n",

        "title": "What is the Performance, Safety, and Alignment of a Data member hidden in an embedded char array in a C++ Class?",
        "body": "<p>I have seen a codebase recently that I fear is violating alignment constraints. I've scrubbed it to produce a minimal example, given below. Briefly, the players are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Pool</em>. This is a class which allocates memory efficiently, for some definition of 'efficient'. <em>Pool</em> is guaranteed to return a chunk of memory that is aligned for the requested size.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Obj_list</em>. This class stores homogeneous collections of objects. Once the number of objects exceeds a certain threshold, it changes its internal representation from a list to a tree. The size of <em>Obj_list</em> is one pointer (8 bytes on a 64-bit platform). Its populated store will of course exceed that.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Aggregate</em>. This class represents a very common object in the system. Its history goes back to the early 32-bit workstation era, and it was 'optimized' (in that same 32-bit era) to use as little space as possible as a result. <em>Aggregate</em>s can be empty, or manage an arbitrary number of objects.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this example, <em>Aggregate</em> items are always allocated from <em>Pool</em>s, so they are always aligned. The only occurrences of <em>Obj_list</em> in this example are the 'hidden' members in <em>Aggregate</em> objects, and therefore they are always allocated using <em>placement new</em>. Here are the support classes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Pool\n{\npublic:\n   Pool();\n   virtual ~Pool();\n   void *allocate(size_t size);\n   static Pool *default_pool();   // returns a global pool\n};\n\nclass Obj_list\n{\npublic:\n   inline void *operator new(size_t s, void * p) { return p; }\n\n   Obj_list(const Args *args);\n   // when constructed, Obj_list will allocate representation_p, which\n   // can take up much more space.\n\n   ~Obj_list();\n\nprivate:\n   Obj_list_store *representation_p;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is Aggregate. Note that member declaration <em>member_list_store_d</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Aggregate is derived from Lesser, which is twelve bytes in size\nclass Aggregate : public Lesser\n{\npublic:\n   inline void *operator new(size_t s) {\n      return Pool::default_pool-&gt;allocate(s);\n   }\n\n   inline void *operator new(size_t s, Pool *h) {\n      return h-&gt;allocate(s);\n   }\n\npublic:\n\n   Aggregate(const Args *args = NULL);\n   virtual ~Aggregate() {};\n\n   inline const Obj_list *member_list_store_p() const;\n\nprotected:\n   char member_list_store_d[sizeof(Obj_list)];\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is that data member that I'm most concerned about. Here is the pseudocode for initialization and access:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Aggregate::Aggregate(const Args *args)\n{\n   if (args) {\n      new (static_cast&lt;void *&gt;(member_list_store_d)) Obj_list(args);\n   }\n   else {\n      zero_out(member_list_store_d);\n   }\n}\n\ninline const Obj_list *Aggregate::member_list_store_p() const\n{\n   return initialized(member_list_store_d) ? (Obj_list *) &amp;member_list_store_d : 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You may be tempted to suggest that we replace the char array with a pointer to the <em>Obj_list</em> type, initialized to NULL or an instance of the class. This gives the proper semantics, but just shifts the memory cost around. If memory were still at a premium (and it might be, this is an EDA database representation), replacing the char array with a pointer to an <em>Obj_list</em> would cost one more pointer in the case when <em>Aggregate</em> objects <em>do</em> have members.</p>\n\n<p>Besides that, I don't really want to get distracted from the main question here, which is alignment. I <em>think</em> the above construct is problematic, but can't really find more in the standard than some vague discussion of the alignment behavior of the 'system/library' <em>new</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So, does the above construct do anything more than cause an occasional pipe stall?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I realize that there are ways to <em>replace</em> the approach using the embedded char array. So did the original architects. They discarded them because memory was at a premium. Now, if I have a reason to touch that code, I'll probably change it.</p>\n\n<p>However, my question, about the alignment issues inherent in this approach, is what I hope people will address. Thanks!</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I have a project that I thought was going to be relatively easy, but is turning out to be more of a pain that I had hoped.  First, most of the code I'm interacting with is legacy code that I don't have control over, so I can't do big paradigm changes.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a simplified explanation of what I need to do:  Say I have a large number of simple programs that read from stdin and write to stdout. (These I can't touch).  Basically, input to stdin is a command like \"Set temperature to 100\" or something like that.  And the output is an event \"Temperature has been set to 100\" or \"Temperature has fallen below setpoint\".</p>\n\n<p>What I'd like to do is write an application that can start a bunch of these simple programs, watch for events and then send commands to them as necessary.  My initial plan was to something like popen, but I need a bidrectional popen to get both read and write pipes.  I hacked something together that I call popen2 where I pass it the command to run and two FILE* that get filled with the read and write stream.  Then all I need to do is write a simple loop that reads from each of the stdouts from each of the processes, does the logic that it needs and then writes commands back to the proper process.</p>\n\n<p>Here's some pseudocode</p>\n\n<pre><code>FILE *p1read, *p1write;\nFILE *p2read, *p2write;\nFILE *p3read, *p3write;\n\n//start each command, attach to stdin and stdout\npopen2(\"process1\",&amp;p1read,&amp;p1write);\npopen2(\"process2\",&amp;p2read,&amp;p2write);\npopen2(\"process3\",&amp;p3read,&amp;p3write);\n\nwhile (1)\n{\n   //read status from each process\n   char status1[1024];\n   char status2[1024];\n   char status3[1024];\n   fread(status1,1024,p1read);\n   fread(status2,1024,p2read);\n   fread(status3,1024,p3read);\n\n   char command1[1024];\n   char command2[1024];\n   char command3[1024];\n   //do some logic here\n\n   //write command back to each process\n   fwrite(command1,p1write);\n   fwrite(command2,p2write);\n   fwrite(command3,p3write);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The real program is more complicated where it peeks in the stream to see if anything is waiting, if not, it will skip that process, likewise if it doesn't need to send a command to a certain process it doesn't.  But this code gives the basic idea.</p>\n\n<p>Now this works great on my UNIX box and even pretty good on a Windows XP box with cygwin.  However, now I need to get it to work on Win32 natively.  </p>\n\n<p>The hard part is that my popen2 uses fork() and execl() to start the process and assign the streams to stdin and stdout of the child processes.  Is there a clean way I can do this in windows?  Basically, I'd like to create a popen2 that works in windows the same way as my unix version.  This way the only windows specific code would be in that function and I could get away with everything else working the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Any Ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n",
