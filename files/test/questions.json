        "body": "<p>I am trying to set up dynamic per-item menus (Edit Control Block) in SharePoint 2007.  My goal is to have certain features that are available based on the current user's group membership.</p>\n\n<p>I know that the CustomAction tag that controls the creation of this menu item has a Rights attribute.  The problem that I have with this is that the groups I am using have identical rights in the site (ViewListItems, ManageAlerts, etc).  The groups that we have set up deal more with function, such as Manager, Employee, etc.  We want to be able to assign a custom feature to a group, and have the menu items associated with that feature visible only to members of that group.  Everyone has the same basic site permissions, but will have extra options availble based on their login credentials.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen several articles on modifying the Core.js file to hide items in the context menu, but they are an all-or-nothing approach.  There is an interesting post at <a href=\"http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2008/04/29/sharepoint-custom-actions-in-a-list-view-webpart.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2008/04/29/sharepoint-custom-actions-in-a-list-view-webpart.aspx</a> that shows how to dynamically modify the Actions menu.  It is trivial to modify this example to check the users group and show or hide the menu based on membership.  Unfortunately, this example does not seem to apply to context menu items as evidenced here <a href=\"http://forums.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/sharepointdevelopment/thread/c2259839-24c4-4a7e-83e5-3925cdd17c44/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://forums.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/sharepointdevelopment/thread/c2259839-24c4-4a7e-83e5-3925cdd17c44/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of a way to do this without using javascript?  If not, what is the best way to check the user's group from javascript?</p>\n",

Most of the web has grown up as a hodge podge of different technologies that have been integrated to work within the browser or to generate html.  JavaScript is  separate from HTML.  Flash and Silverlight are plugged in the mix as well.   We can get the job done with the tools we have but can we do better?  <br>\nBefore you mention standards, (which are a good thing to have), think about evolutionary change versus revolutionary change.  If Henry Ford asked people about a better way to get around they would have said they wanted a faster horse.  (Webkit is a faster horse.) <br>\nI am hoping there is a project and I just haven’t read of it.</p>\n",

This works fine in Webkit and Gecko, but for some reason moveToElementText is spitting out an Invalid Argument exception.  It doesn't matter which element we pass to it, the function seems to be completely broken.  In other code paths, however, this function seems to work.</p>\n\n<p>To reproduce the error using the link above, click in the main text input area, type anything, then click on the yellow page icon with the green plus sign, type anything into the lightbox dialog, and click on Insert.

I'm calling this after the user has been idle for a certain amount of time and I would like to save any data they've typed.  When I try this the page reloads (the action is #) but any new text typed in the fields is not passed in the REQUEST, so I don't get to put it in the DB.  Is there some fundamental reason why this happens or is my code just not playing nice together (I'm using the EXTJS grid view to show the form and a library for tracking idle time)?\nThanks,\nRobert</p>\n",

I'm using firebug to view the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be splentabulous!</p>\n\n<p>The jQuery Code</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(function() { \n    $(\".digi_image:gt(-1):lt(4)\").wrapAll(\"&lt;div class=\\\"digi_pane\\\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid red\");\n    $(\".digi_image:gt(3):lt(8)\").wrapAll(\"&lt;div class=\\\"digi_pane\\\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid blue\");\n    $(\".digi_image:gt(7):lt(12)\").wrapAll(\"&lt;div class=\\\"digi_pane\\\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid green\");\n    $(\".digi_image:gt(11):lt(16)\").wrapAll(\"&lt;div class=\\\"digi_pane\\\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid orange\");\n    $(\".digi_pane\").append(\"&lt;div style=\\\"clear: both;\\\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\");\n}); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The HTML (abbreviated), but essentially repeated 16 times.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"digi_image\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"space_holder\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"images/n883470064_4126667_9320.jpg\" width=\"100\" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",

Last year, the company that had done the site just fed the KML data directly to the gMaps API and let it place all of the markers client side. Obviously, that became a performance nightmare and tended to make older browsers \"freeze\" (or at least appear frozen for several minutes at a time).</p>\n\n<p>Ideally this server side script would take the KML, the map's lat/lon center, and the map zoom level and appropriately merge all of the visible place markers into a single GIF or PNG overlay.</p>\n\n<p>Any guidance or recommendations on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 10/8/2008</strong> - Most of the information I've come across here and other places would seem to indicate that lessening the number of points on the map is the way to go (i.e. using one marker to represent several when viewing from a higher altitude/zoom level).  While that's probably a good approach in some cases, it won't work here.  We're looking for the visual impact of a US map with many thousand markers on it.  One option I've explored is a service called <a href=\"http://www.pushpin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PushPin</a>, which when fed (presumably) KML will create, server side, an overlay that has all of the visible points (based on center lat/lon and zoom level) rendered onto a single image, so instead of performing several thousand DOM manipulations client side, we merge all of those markers into a single image server side and do a single DOM manipulation on the client end.  The PushPin service is really slick and would definitely work if not for the associated costs.  We're really looking for something F/OSS that <em>we</em> could run server side to generate that overlay ourselves.</p>\n",

The code works great on single pages (i.e. no master), however, when I try and apply the effects to a content page within a master, it does not work.</p>\n\n<p>In short I have a master page which contains the main script reference. All pages will use the script, but the parameters passed to it will differ for the content pages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Master Page Script Reference</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"scripts.js\" language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Single Page</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    MakePretty(\"elementID\");\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, I need the reference in each page (hence it being in the master) but the actual elements I want to \"MakePretty\" will change dependant on content.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content Pages</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, due to the content page not having a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, I have been using the following code to add it to the master pages <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HtmlGenericControl ctl = new HtmlGenericControl(\"script\");\nctl.Attributes.Add(\"language\", \"javascript\");\nctl.InnerHtml = @\"MakePretty(\"\"elementID\"\")\";\nMaster.Page.Header.Controls.Add(ctl);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, this <strong>fails to work</strong>. However, if I replace with something simple like <code>alert(\"HI!\")</code>, all works fine. So the code is being added OK, it just doesn't seem to always execute depending on what it is doing..</p>\n\n<p>Now, having done some digging, I have learned that th content page's <code>Load</code> event is raised before the master pages, which may be having an effect, however, I thought the javascript on the page was all loaded/run at once?</p>\n\n<p>Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I am still relatively new to using javascript, especially in the master pages scenario.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I get content pages to call javascript code which is referenced in the Master page?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any/all help on this guys, you will really be helping me out with this work problem.</p>\n\n<h2>NOTES:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>RegisterStartupScript</code> and the like does not seem to work at any level..</li>\n<li>The control ID's are being set fine, even in the MasterPage environment and are rendering as expected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Apologies if any of this is unclear, I am real tired so if need be please comment if a re-word/clarification is required.</p>\n",

The problem is not jstemplate.js but util.js, which it needs as a support file.</p>\n\n<p>I've isolated the problem as follows::</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=\"VB\" %&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;\n        &lt;asp:scriptmanager id=\"ScriptManager\" runat=\"server\" enablepartialrendering=\"true\"&gt;\n            &lt;scripts&gt;\n                &lt;asp:scriptreference path=\"http://google-jstemplate.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/util.js\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/scripts&gt;\n        &lt;/asp:scriptmanager&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run this I get this error </p>\n\n<pre><code>Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'type' is null or not an object`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>on this line of <code>MicrosoftAjax.js</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code> Sys.UI.DomEvent = function Sys$UI$DomEvent(eventObject) {\n ...\n var etype = this.type = e.type.toLowerCase();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Referencing the javascript in a normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block (as opposed to inside the ScriptManager) has the same effect.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't dug into it but I suspect there's just a namespace collision. Has anyone successfully used Google's util.js file alongside ASP.NET ajax? Or should I just look into alternative client-side templating engines?</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>Thanks for reading. I'm a bit new to jQuery, and am trying to make a script I can include in all my websites to solve a problem that always drives me crazy...</p>\n\n<p>The problem:\nSelect boxes with long options get cut off in Internet Explorer. For example, these select boxes:\n<a href=\"http://discoverfire.com/test/select.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://discoverfire.com/test/select.php</a></p>\n\n<p>In Firefox they are fine, but in IE, the options are cut off to the width of the select when they drop down.</p>\n\n<p>The solution:\nWhat I am looking to do, is create a script that I can include in any page that will do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Loop through all the selects on the page.</p></li>\n<li><p>For each select:\nA. Loop through its options.\nB. Find the width of the longest option.\nC. Bind a function to expand the select to that width on focus (or maybe click...).\nD. Bind a function to shrink to it's original width on blur.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I've managed to do most of step #2 for one select box.</p>\n\n<p>I found that getting the options width was a problem (especially in IE), so I looped through and copied the text of each option to a span, measured the span width, and used the longest one as the width the select will be expanded to. Perhaps somebody has a better idea.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n\n      $(function() {\n\n         /*\n         This function will:\n            1. Create a data store for the select called ResizeToWidth.\n            2. Populate it with the width of the longest option, as approximated by span width.\n\n         The data store can then be used\n         */\n         // Make a temporary span to hold the text of the options.\n         $('body').append(\"&lt;span id='CurrentOptWidth'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\");\n\n         $(\"#TheSelect option\").each(function(i){\n\n            // If this is the first time through, zero out ResizeToWidth (or it will end up NaN).\n            if ( isNaN( $(this).parent().data('ResizeToWidth') ) ) {\n               $(this).parent().data( 'OriginalWidth', $(this).parent().width() );\n               $(this).parent().data('ResizeToWidth', 0);\n\n               $('CurrentOptWidth').css('font-family', $(this).css('font-family') );\n               $('CurrentOptWidth').css('font-size', $(this).css('font-size') );\n               $('CurrentOptWidth').css('font-weight', $(this).css('font-weight') );\n\n            }\n\n            // Put the text of the current option into the span.\n            $('#CurrentOptWidth').text( $(this).text() );\n\n            // Set ResizeToWidth to the longer of a) the current opt width, or b) itself. \n            //So it will hold the width of the longest option when we are done\n            ResizeToWidth = Math.max( $('#CurrentOptWidth').width() , $(this).parent().data('ResizeToWidth') );\n\n            // Update parent ResizeToWidth data.\n            $(this).parent().data('ResizeToWidth', ResizeToWidth)\n\n          });\n\n         // Remove the temporary span.\n         $('#CurrentOptWidth').remove();\n\n         $('#TheSelect').focus(function(){\n            $(this).width( $(this).data('ResizeToWidth') );\n         });\n\n         $('#TheSelect').blur(function(){\n            $(this).width( $(this).data('OriginalWidth') );\n         });\n\n\n           alert( $('#TheSelect').data('OriginalWidth') );\n           alert( $('#TheSelect').data('ResizeToWidth') );\n\n      });\n\n\n   &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the select:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select id='TheSelect' style='width:50px;'&gt;\n   &lt;option value='1'&gt;One&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='2'&gt;Two&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='3'&gt;Three&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='42,693,748,756'&gt;Forty-two billion, six-hundred and ninety-three million, seven-hundred-forty-some-odd..... &lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='5'&gt;Five&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='6'&gt;Six&lt;/option&gt;\n   &lt;option value='7'&gt;Seven...&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hopefully this will run for you if you want to run it, or you can see it in action here: <a href=\"http://discoverfire.com/test/select.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://discoverfire.com/test/select.php</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What I need help with:\nThis needs a bit of polish, but seems to work ok if you specify the select box.</p>\n\n<p>However, I don't seem to be able to figure out how to apply it to all select boxes on the page with a loop. So far, I have this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('select').each(\n   function(i, select){\n      // Get the options for the select here... can I use select.each...?\n   }\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, is there a better way to get the length of the longest option for each select? The span is close, but not very exact. The problem is that IE returns zero for the option widths of the actual selects.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas are very welcome, both for the questions asked, and any other improvements to my code.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n",

I also don't want to just set the position to \"fixed\" because I want it to scroll until it would scroll off the page, and only then become \"fixed\" (and likewise, if the user later scrolls back up, I want the map to become \"unstuck\" and scroll back down the page).  </p>\n\n<p>I imagine that this could be accomplished with some convoluted javascript (using \"watch\", etc) that detects when the map is near the top of the page and changes the CSS values appropriately, but I was hoping for a combination of relative/absolute/fixed positioned divs that obviated the need for Javascript at all.  </p>\n\n<p>And of course what I'd <em>really</em> like is a drop-in library (or jQuery plugin, etc) that does just what I am looking for, if such a thing exists.  If no off-the-shelf scripts exist to do this, I'd love to hear from people with first hand experience doing or trying to do the same thing.</p>\n",

The problem cannot be with the function itself because it works brilliantly in every section except for one.  Here is the JS function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  function updateFields() {\n    document.getElementById('bf').innerHTML = bill.time[breakfast][bill.pointPartOfWeek];\n    document.getElementById('ln').innerHTML = bill.time[lunch][bill.pointPartOfWeek];\n    document.getElementById('dn').innerHTML = bill.time[dinner][bill.pointPartOfWeek];\n    document.getElementById('se').innerHTML = bill.time[special][bill.pointPartOfWeek];\n    document.getElementById('fdr').innerHTML = bill.time[full][bill.pointPartOfWeek];\n    document.getElementById('cost').innerHTML = bill.cost;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it executes fine in the following instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;select onchange='if(this.selectedIndex == 0) {bill.unholiday();updateFields()} else { bill.holiday();updateFields()}' id='date' name='date'&gt;\n    &lt;option value='else'&gt;Jan. 02 - Nov. 20&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;option value='christmas'&gt;Nov. 20 - Jan. 01&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but in this very similar code, the last line of the function doesn't seem to execute (it doesn't update the cost field, but updates everything else)</p>\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;select onchange='if(this.selectedIndex == 0) {bill.pointPartOfWeek = 1;} else { bill.pointPartOfWeek = 2;}updateFields();alert(updateFields());' id='day' name='day'&gt;\n    &lt;option value='0'&gt;Monday thru Thursday&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;option value='1'&gt;Friday, Saturday, or Sunday&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;/select&gt;\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Strangely enough, the total cost variable itself is updated, but the field that represents the variable is not.  If you use another section of the page that wouldn't change the value of the total cost but calls the updateFields function again, the cost field then updates correctly.  It must be an issue with the function called.  </p>\n\n<p>Note: we know that the function executes because it does 5 out of 6 of the things it is supposed to do.  This is a strange issue. </p>\n\n<p>Edit:  The pastebin for the entire page my be helpful.

One of the things that we will be using this for is to drive a \"Computers Currently In Use\" map for our larger computer labs so that users can find an open computer more easily (the lab in our Main library has around 150 computers).  The image used for the background of the display of this page is managed through the administrative part of the application as are the relationships between what stations are located in the lab and where they are located.</p>\n\n<p>We'd like to make it so that admins can \"turn off\" the display of the map page for each location when the map is being updated in the administrative interface.  My idea is to extend the table that holds the location data to indicate whether the location is available for map display, and check this when the map is updated.  If the check indicates that the map should not be displayed, the page would draw a suitable message instead of displaying the map image and \"in use\" overlay data.</p>\n\n<p>In the hopes that someone else may have done this, or something like it, before, I'd like to hear your suggestions on alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>The map page will be refreshed periodically (one every 2 minutes) via AJAX by passing down the image url to use and the overlay data (positions of table and number of computers available at each).  I'm thinking that when the page detects a transition from \"don't display\" to \"display\" it would refresh the page via HTTP GET.</p>\n",

Our web analytics company works as a consultant for large sites, and (other than adding a single SCRIPT tag) we have no control over the pages themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Our existing script installs handlers using \"old\" way (a fancy version of element.onclick = blah; that also executes the original handler) which is completely unaware of \"new\" (addEventListener or attachEvent) handlers on the page. We'd like to fix this to make our script able to run on more sites without requiring as much custom development.</p>\n\n<p>The initial thought here was to have our own script use addEventListener/attachEvent, but this presents a problem: of the client's site sets a handler using the \"old\" way, it would wipe out the handler we installed the \"new\" way. Quick and dirty testing shows this happens in both IE7 and FF3, although I didn't test the whole range of browsers. There's also a risk that if we use the \"new\" way after the page's event handlers are already set, we could erase their handlers.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: what safe technique can I use to add an event handler in Javascript using addEventListener/attachEvent that works regardless of how other event handlers on the page are installed?</p>\n\n<p>Please remember: we have no way of modifying the site that our script is installed on. (I have to emphasize that because the default answer to questions like this is always, \"just rewrite the page to do everything the same way.\")</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I have a case where I have a bunch of text boxes and radio buttons on a screen all built dynamically with various DIVs.  There are onblur routines for all of the text boxes to validate entry, but depending on the radio button selection, the text box entry could be invalid when it was valid originally.  I can't use onblur with the radio buttons because they could go from the radio button into one of the text boxes that was made invalid and create an infinite loop since I'm putting focus into the invalid element.  Since each text box has its own special parameters for the onblur calls, I figure the best way to do this is to call the onblur event for the textboxes when the form gets submitted to make sure all entry is still valid with the radio button configuration they have selected.  I also need it to stop submitting if one of the onblur events returns false so they can correct the textbox that is wrong.  This is what I've written...</p>\n\n<pre><code>    for (var intElement = 0; intElement &lt; document.forms[0].elements.length; intElement = intElement + 1)\n    {\n        if (document.forms[0].elements[intElement].name.substr(3) == \"FactorAmount\") // The first 3 characters of the name are a unique identifier for each field\n        {\n            if (document.forms[0].elements[intElement].onblur())\n            {\n                return false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nreturn true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I originally had (!document.forms[0].elements[intElement].onblur()) but the alert messages from the onblur events weren't popping up when I had that.  Now the alert messages are popping up, but it's still continuing to loop through elements if it hits an error. I've stepped through this with a debugger both ways, and it appears to be looping just fine, but it's either 1) not stopping and returning false when I need it to or 2) not executing my alert messages to tell the user what the error was.

The line below...</p>\n\n<pre><code>            if (!document.forms[0].elements[intElement].onblur())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>            if (document.forms[0].elements[intElement].onblur())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is not returning what the single onblur function (f_VerifyRange) is returning.  Instead it is always returning either true or false no matter what.  In the first case, it returns true and then quits and aborts the submit after the first textbox even though there was no error with the first textbox.  In the second case, it returns false and runs through all the boxes.  Even though there might have been errors (which it displays), it doesn't think there are any errors, so it continues on with the submit.  I guess what I really need is how to get the return value from f_VerifyRange which is my onblur function.</p>\n",

I'm using the following methods to set the position and size: </p>\n\n<pre><code>function getWindowWidth() {\n  var windowWidth = 0;\n  if (typeof(window.innerWidth) == 'number') {\n    windowWidth=window.innerWidth;\n  }\n  else {\n    if (document.documentElement &amp;&amp; document.documentElement.clientWidth) {\n      windowWidth=document.documentElement.clientWidth  ;\n    }\n    else {\n      if (document.body &amp;&amp; document.body.clientWidth) {\n        windowWidth=document.body.clientWidth;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return windowWidth;\n}\n\nfunction findLPos(obj) { \n  var curleft = 0; \n  if (obj.offsetParent) { \n    curleft = obj.offsetLeft \n    while (obj = obj.offsetParent) { \n      curleft += obj.offsetLeft \n    } \n  } \n  return curleft; \n}\n\nvar bdydiv;\nvar coldiv;\n\ndocument.body.style.overflow=\"hidden\";\nwindow.onload=resizeDivs;\nwindow.onresize=resizeDivs; \n\nfunction resizeDivs(){\n  bdydiv=document.getElementById('bdydiv');\n  coldiv=document.getElementById('coldiv');\n  var winWdth=getWindowWidth();\n  var rghtMarg = 0;\n  var colHdrTbl=document.getElementById('colHdrTbl');\n  rghtMarg = parseInt((winWdth - 766) / 2) - 8;\n  rghtMarg = (rghtMarg &gt; 0 ? rghtMarg : 0);\n  coldiv.style.paddingLeft = rghtMarg + \"px\";\n  bdydiv.style.paddingLeft = rghtMarg + \"px\";\n  var bdydivLft=findLPos(bdydiv);\n  if ((winWdth - bdydivLft) &gt;= 1){\n    bdydiv.style.width = winWdth - bdydivLft;\n    coldiv.style.width = bdydiv.style.width;\n  }\n  syncScroll();\n}\n\nfunction syncScroll(){\n  if(coldiv.scrollLeft&gt;=0){\n    coldiv.scrollLeft=bdydiv.scrollLeft;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that I've cut out other code which sets height, and other non-relevant parts. The full page can be seen <a href=\"http://site1.funddata.com/mozilladivresize.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. If you go to the link in both IE and firefox, resize width until \"800\" is displayed in the green box top-right, and resize height until the scrollbar at the right is enabled, you can see the problem. If you then resize the IE width, the scrollbar stays, but if you resize the firefox width wider, the scrollbar begins to disappear. I'm at a loss as to why this is happening....</p>\n\n<p>Note that AFAIK, getWindowWidth() should be cross-browser-compatible, but I'm not so sure about findLPos().... perhaps there's an extra object in Firefox's DOM or something, which is changing the result??</p>\n",

The user submits PageA, hits Back, and nothing happens. That's good. Now the user clicks a link to PageB.aspx, which does <em>not</em> have the code. When the user clicks the Back button, which should take her to PageA.aspx, it does not.

This uses the background color in floating DIVs to generate the bars.  I would like to be able to read the browser setting for printing background colors, and if not checked, either warn the user that the colors won't print, or programatically select this option.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As I think about the products that do something similar, I think they mostly just test whether Java or JavaScript or Cookies are disabled, which can be done without reading the registry.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess the consensus is that what I want to do shouldn't be attempted.</p>\n",
