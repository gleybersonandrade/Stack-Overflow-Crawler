Each platform has GCC available and uses the same shell.</p>\n\n<p>One idea was to have the C compiled to the users local ~/bin, with timestamp comparison with C code so it is not compiled each run, but only when code is updated. Another was to just compile it for each platform, and have the wrapper script select the proper executable.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an accepted/stable process for this? Are there any catches?

Hence, this is OK in C, but not in C++:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef enum Foo\n{\n    Foo_First = 1&lt;&lt;0,\n    Foo_Second = 1&lt;&lt;1,\n} Foo;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    Foo x = Foo_First | Foo_Second; // error in C++\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How should this problem be handled efficiently and correctly, ideally without harming the debugger-friendly nature of using Foo as the variable type (it decomposes into the component bitflags in watches etc.)?</p>\n\n<p>Consider also that there may be hundreds of such flag enumerations, and many thousands of use-points.

This C object is to be associated with a Java object, and once the application is finished with the Java object, I have no more need for the C object.</p>\n\n<p>I am creating the Java object like so (error checking elided for clarity):</p>\n\n<pre><code>c_object = c_object_create ();\nclass = (*env)-&gt;FindClass (env, \"my.class.name\");\nconstructor = (*env)-&gt;GetMethodID (env, class, \"&lt;init&gt;\", \"(J)V\");\ninstance = (*env)-&gt;NewObject (env, class, constructor, (jlong) c_object);\n\nmethod = (*env)-&gt;GetMethodID (env, other_class, \"doSomeWork\", \"(Lmy.class.name)V\");\n(*env)-&gt;CallVoidMethod (env, other_class, method, instance);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, now that I'm done with <code>instance</code>, what do I do with it?  Ideally, I'd like to leave the garbage collection up to the VM; when it's done with <code>instance</code> it would be fantastic if it also called <code>c_object_destroy()</code> on the pointer I provided to it.  Is this possible?</p>\n\n<p>A separate, but related question has to do with the scope of Java entities that I create in a method like this; do I have to manually release, say, <code>class</code>, <code>constructor</code>, or <code>method</code> above?  The JNI doc is frustratingly vague (in my judgement) on the subject of proper memory management.</p>\n",

        "title": "Crossplatform Bidirectional IPC",
        "body": "<p>I have a project that I thought was going to be relatively easy, but is turning out to be more of a pain that I had hoped.  First, most of the code I'm interacting with is legacy code that I don't have control over, so I can't do big paradigm changes.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a simplified explanation of what I need to do:  Say I have a large number of simple programs that read from stdin and write to stdout. (These I can't touch).  Basically, input to stdin is a command like \"Set temperature to 100\" or something like that.  And the output is an event \"Temperature has been set to 100\" or \"Temperature has fallen below setpoint\".</p>\n\n<p>What I'd like to do is write an application that can start a bunch of these simple programs, watch for events and then send commands to them as necessary.  My initial plan was to something like popen, but I need a bidrectional popen to get both read and write pipes.  I hacked something together that I call popen2 where I pass it the command to run and two FILE* that get filled with the read and write stream.  Then all I need to do is write a simple loop that reads from each of the stdouts from each of the processes, does the logic that it needs and then writes commands back to the proper process.</p>\n\n<p>Here's some pseudocode</p>\n\n<pre><code>FILE *p1read, *p1write;\nFILE *p2read, *p2write;\nFILE *p3read, *p3write;\n\n//start each command, attach to stdin and stdout\npopen2(\"process1\",&amp;p1read,&amp;p1write);\npopen2(\"process2\",&amp;p2read,&amp;p2write);\npopen2(\"process3\",&amp;p3read,&amp;p3write);\n\nwhile (1)\n{\n   //read status from each process\n   char status1[1024];\n   char status2[1024];\n   char status3[1024];\n   fread(status1,1024,p1read);\n   fread(status2,1024,p2read);\n   fread(status3,1024,p3read);\n\n   char command1[1024];\n   char command2[1024];\n   char command3[1024];\n   //do some logic here\n\n   //write command back to each process\n   fwrite(command1,p1write);\n   fwrite(command2,p2write);\n   fwrite(command3,p3write);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The real program is more complicated where it peeks in the stream to see if anything is waiting, if not, it will skip that process, likewise if it doesn't need to send a command to a certain process it doesn't.  But this code gives the basic idea.</p>\n\n<p>Now this works great on my UNIX box and even pretty good on a Windows XP box with cygwin.  However, now I need to get it to work on Win32 natively.  </p>\n\n<p>The hard part is that my popen2 uses fork() and execl() to start the process and assign the streams to stdin and stdout of the child processes.  Is there a clean way I can do this in windows?  Basically, I'd like to create a popen2 that works in windows the same way as my unix version.  This way the only windows specific code would be in that function and I could get away with everything else working the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Any Ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n",

I am implementing some functionality regarding time and I want to represent my time using the 64 bit integer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef int64 mytime;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also want all the common operations available to the int64 type to be available for my time type as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define mytime_add(x, y) (mytime) int64_add((int64) (x), (int64) (y))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that the casts between the types mytime and int64 isn't allowed in C (as far as I can tell anyhow).

The problem with this is that I'm not sure if I always want to represent time as a 64 bit integer. Then there's the issue of readable code as well... :-)</p>\n",

I mocked the command dispatcher in VC and had it working to my satisfaction; but when I then moved the code over to the embedded environment, I found out that the compiler has a broken implementation of pointer-to-func's.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how I originally implemented the code (in VC):</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* Relevant parts of header file  */\ntypedef struct command {\n  const char *code;\n  void *set_dispatcher;\n  void *get_dispatcher;\n  const char *_description;\n} command_t;\n\n#define COMMAND_ENTRY(label,dispatcher,description) {(const char*)label, &amp;set_##dispatcher, &amp;get_##dispatcher, (const char*)description} \n\n\n/* Dispatcher data structure in the C file */\nconst command_t commands[] = {\n  COMMAND_ENTRY(\"DH\", Dhcp, \"DHCP (0=off, 1=on)\"),\n  COMMAND_ENTRY(\"IP\", Ip, \"IP Address (192.168.1.205)\"),\n  COMMAND_ENTRY(\"SM\", Subnet, \"Subunet Mask (255.255.255.0)\"),\n  COMMAND_ENTRY(\"DR\", DefaultRoute, \"Default router (192.168.1.1)\"),\n  COMMAND_ENTRY(\"UN\", Username, \"Web username\"),\n  COMMAND_ENTRY(\"PW\", Password, \"Web password\"),\n  ...\n}\n\n\n/* After matching the received command string to the command \"label\", the command is dispatched */\nif (pc-&gt;isGetter)\n  return ((get_fn_t)(commands[i].get_dispatcher))(pc);\nelse\n  return ((set_fn_t)(commands[i].set_dispatcher))(pc);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without the use of function pointers, it seems like my only hope is to use switch()/case statements to call functions.  But I'd like to avoid having to manually maintain a large switch() statement.  </p>\n\n<p>What I was thinking of doing is moving all the COMMAND_ENTRY lines into a separate include file.  Then wraps that include file with varying #define and #undefines.  Something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* Create enum's labels */\n#define COMMAND_ENTRY(label,dispatcher,description) SET_##dispatcher, GET_##dispatcher\ntypedef enum command_labels = {\n#include \"entries.cinc\"\n  DUMMY_ENUM_ENTRY} command_labels_t;\n#undefine COMMAND_ENTRY\n\n\n/* Create command mapping table */\n#define COMMAND_ENTRY(label,dispatcher,description) {(const char*)label, SET_##dispatcher, GET_##dispatcher, (const char*)description} \nconst command_t commands[] = {\n#include \"entries.cinc\"\n  NULL /* dummy */ };\n#undefine COMMAND_ENTRY\n\n/*...*/\n\nint command_dispatcher(command_labels_t dispatcher_id) {\n/* Create dispatcher switch statement */\n#define COMMAND_ENTRY(label,dispatcher,description) case SET_##dispatcher: return set_##dispatcher(pc); case GET_##dispatcher: return get_##dispatcher(pc);\nswitch(dispatcher_id) {\n#include \"entries.cinc\"\ndefault:\n  return NOT_FOUND;\n}\n#undefine COMMAND_ENTRY\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone see a better way to handle this situation?  Sadly, 'get another compiler' is not a viable option. :(</p>\n\n<p>--- Edit to add:\nJust to clarify, the particular embedded environment is broken in that the compiler is <em>supposed</em> to create a \"function-pointer table\" which is then used by the compiler to resolve calls to functions through a pointer.  Unfortunately, the compiler is broken and doesn't generate a correct function-table.</p>\n\n<p>So I don't have an easy way to extract the func address to invoke it.</p>\n\n<p>--- Edit #2:\nAh, yes, the use of void *(set|get)_dispatcher was my attempt to see if the problem was with the typedefine of the func pointers.  Originally, I had</p>\n\n<pre><code>typedef int (*set_fn_t)(cmdContext_t *pCmdCtx);\ntypedef int (*get_fn_t)(cmdContext_t *pCmdCtx);\n\ntypedef struct command {\n  const char *code;\n  set_fn_t set_dispatcher;\n  get_fn_t get_dispatcher;\n  const char *_description;\n} command_t;\n</code></pre>\n",

I don't like it for two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It makes the code more complex. One line of code to call a function is replaced with three lines of code, one to define the function signature, one to call GetProcAddress, and one to actually call the function. </li>\n<li>It's more prone to run-time errors. If I misspell the function name or mess up the signature I don't see the error until run-time. Say I decide to integrate a new version of the dll and one of the method names has changed, it will compile just fine and won't have a problem until the actual call to GetProcAddress, which could possibly even be missed in a test pass.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It has the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BuildLog.html</li>\n<li>mt.dep</li>\n<li>test1.obj</li>\n<li>vc90.idb</li>\n<li>vc90.pdb</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But that is all! No EXE. I've looked through all the options and made sure that it is set to compile to an exe and i checked the output file. That is $(OutDir)\\$(ProjectName).exe. But alas, no exe appears. Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Also when i try to hit f5 and run with debut i get an error that says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This application has failed to start\n  because MSVCR90.DLL was not found.\n  Re-installing the application may fix\n  this problem</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

It will in turn update the current EnvStack data structure and call the OpenGL environment function.\n<li>Alter the OpenGL environment functions to point to <b>my</b> environment functions, which will again update the current EnvStack data structure and call the original OpenGL environment functions.\n</ol>\n\n<p>So option 1 is obviously much simpler. But I run into a problem if I'm using other peoples code in that I don't necessarily know what changes it's making to the environement and therefor my data structure would be out of sync. And since the whole point is to have a simple method of ensuring the environment settings are correct, this is not cool.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, in this context, how do I change the functions that the OpenGL environment functions point to?</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I'm a beginner programmer and I'm learning my first language, C. </p>\n\n<p>I'm learning mostly from Deitel and Deitel's C How to Program book, but also using example tasks and things from the university, however I am stuck on one.</p>\n\n<p>I have a very very basic understanding of pointers - adding &amp; in front of a variable makes it print an address and * uses a pointer to use the value stored at that address or such.</p>\n\n<p>The piece of code I've written is for calculating the greatest (largest?) common denominator of two numbers and doesn't actually need or involve pointers at all. It uses two functions and the logic is all correct because it prints out the correct answer to the screen if I do it from the second function, rather than returning it to the main. This is where the problem lies. </p>\n\n<p>When the second function returns the answer value, for some reason it returns what I can only assume is a pointer. I have no idea why it does this. I would be able to work with this and convert it to look up the value - however it seems to be a pointer local the second function and is written over. Nothing on the web that I could find or in my book gave me any idea how to solve the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks if you've read this far. I've rambled far too much.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code and output. Any help or pointers (excuse the pun) would be greatly appreciated. I know I could just have it print in the second function but I would prefer to know how and why it doesn't return the value like I would like it to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint greatestCD (int num1, int num2);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    int a=0, b=0;\n    int result;\n    printf(\"Please enter two numbers to calculate the greatest common denominator from\\n\");\n    scanf(\"%d%d\", &amp;a, &amp;b);\n    result = greatestCD (a,b);\n    printf(\"Using the correct in main way:\\nThe greatest common denominator of %d and %d is %d\\n\",a,b, result);\n}\n\nint greatestCD (int num1 ,int num2)\n{ \n\n    if (num2==0){\n        printf(\"Using the cheaty in gcd function way:\\nThe greatest common denominator is %d\\n\",num1);\n        return num1;\n    } else {\n        greatestCD(num2,(num1%num2));\n    }    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Output (using 12 and 15 - the answer should be 3)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\Sam\\Documents\\C programs&gt;gcd\nPlease enter two numbers to calculate the greatest common denominator from\n12\n15\nUsing the cheaty in gcd function way:\nThe greatest common denominator is 3\nUsing the correct in main way:\nThe greatest common denominator of 12 and 15 is 2293524\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Such a simple solution from frankodwyer. It's tiny things like that I either can't spot or don't know about. So what was being returned wasn't a pointer and was just junk?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a million.</p>\n",

After this i guess formatting will be really easy. Any alternative method (instead mounting) for formatting file to different FAT (12/32) and ext3 are welcomed :) </p>\n\n<p>I would prefer to do it in C/C++, but in the worst case i can use external commands i.e \nrunning ready executable from my application. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>\nIt seems like Windows does not allow this natively, so it will be best to find some application that doing <strong>exactly</strong>  this i.e mounting file as a files system. Otherwise i have a problem with open source licenses.</p>\n",

The downside to that is that the first functions defined in the file are the lowest-level routines - the ones that are called by functions defined later in the file - so rather than having the most important code at the top, it is nearer the bottom of the file.

The context is opaque, so the client can't really muck around in there; it's only intended for the internal use of the API functions.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm running into is that callers are allocating the context, but not initializing it.

I'm not sure if this is possible. Two ideas I've thought of are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use a pre-defined constant and store it in a \"magic\" field of the context to be verified at API invocation time.</li>\n<li>Use a checksum of the contents of the context, storing this in the \"magic\" field and verifying it at invocation time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I know that either one of these options could result in a false positive verification, either because random crap in memory matches the \"magic\" number, or because the context happens to occupy the same space as a previously initialized context. I think the latter scenario is more likely.</p>\n\n<p>Does this simply boil down to a question of probability? That I can avoid false positives in most cases, but not all?

It's offering examples and compliant solutions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n  /* ... */\n  char prog_name[128];\n  strcpy(prog_name, argv[0]);\n  /* ... */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And their alternative is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n  /* ... */\n  char *prog_name = (char *)malloc(strlen(argv[0])+1);\n  if (prog_name != NULL) {\n    strcpy(prog_name, argv[0]);\n  }\n  else {\n    /* Couldn't get the memory - recover */\n  }\n  /* ... */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Taken from here, <a href=\"https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/STR31-C.+Guarantee+that+storage+for+strings+has+sufficient+space+for+character+data+and+the+null+terminator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2nd example</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But as far as I get it that's just more challenging, more code, more work. Why does no one change the library itself? Or at least why does no one provide a secure alternative library or functions, which handle this in the right way?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading,\nwishi</p>\n",

(<em>Update</em>: When I talk of precision here, I mean precision /and/ range.) Under these circumstances it is conceivable that the comparison (<code>x &lt;= 0</code>) returns false even though the next time x is rounded down to double precision it becomes 0.

        "body": "<p>I've been trying to get this code to work for hours!  All I need to do is open a file to see if it is real and readable.  I'm new to C so I'm sure there is something stupid I'm missing.  Here is the code (shorthand, but copied):</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nmain() {\n    char fpath[200];\n    char file = \"/test/file.this\";\n    sprintf(fpath,\"~cs4352/projects/proj0%s\",file);\n\n    FILE *fp = fopen(fpath,\"r\");\n    if(fp==NULL) {\n        printf(\"There is no file on the server\");\n        exit(1);\n    }\n    fclose(fp);\n    //do more stuff\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also verified that the path is correctly specifying a real file that I have read permissions to.  Any other ideas?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> I do know that the fpath ends up as \"~cs4352/projects/proj0/test/file.this\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I have also tried the using the absolute file path.  In both cases, I can verify that the paths are properly built via ls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> There <code>errno</code> is 2...  I'm currently trying to track what that means in google.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong>  Ok, <code>errno</code> of 2 is \"There is no such file or directory\".  I am getting this when the reference path in fopen is \"/home/courses1/cs4352/projects/proj0/index.html\" which I verified does exist and I have read rights to it.  As for the C code listed below, there may be a few semantic/newbie errors in it, but gcc does not give me any compile time warnings, and the code works exactly as it should except that it says that it keeps spitting <code>errno</code> of 2.  In other words, I know that all the strings/char array are working properly, but the only thing that could be an issue is the <code>fopen()</code> call.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong>  Ok, the access() procedure is what helped me the most (and what i am still using as it is less code, not to mention the more elegant way of doing it).  The problem actually came from something that I didn't explain to you all (because I didn't see it until I used access()).  To derrive the file, I was splitting strings using strtok() and was only splitting on \" \\n\", but because this is a UNIX system, I needed to add \"\\r\" to it as well.  Once I fixed that, everything fell into place, and I'm sure that the fopen() function would work as well, but I have not tested it.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for your helpful suggestions, and especially to Paul Beckingham for finding this wonderful solution.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n",
